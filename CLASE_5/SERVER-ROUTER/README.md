# Server Router Example

This is a simple example of a server router implemented in Node.js using the `http` module. The server listens for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate handler based on the URL path.

## Setup
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it.
